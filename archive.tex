\begin{equation*}
    P(X - 1) =
    \begin{cases}
    \gamma + (1-\gamma)\frac{1}{1+e'[-\eta]} & \text{Item Response Theory} \\ %That is an ugly negation slash but I can't find a better looking one atm
    q + (1-q)b & \text{Multinomial Processing Tree}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

q is the probability that you know the item
1-q you don't know the item but guess (b)
where $\gamma$ and $q$ are unknown but we want to estimate it.

\begin{equation*}    
    \gamma &= b
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    q &= \frac{1}{1+e'{-\eta}}
\end{equation*}


\begin{equation*}
J = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{q(1-q)} 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

eta is the difference entween item difficulty and participants ability

Items own dificulty
Persons own ability

eta would have subscripts ip, but there are not ixp of them, there are i+p of them

The dominance parameter is always split between person and item

Three items, two people
